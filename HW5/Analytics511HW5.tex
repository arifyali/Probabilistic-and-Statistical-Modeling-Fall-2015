\section*{Exercise 33}

Thh ECDF plot looks kinda of like a log plot going from 0 to 60, with
0 to 60 representing the minute mark on the hour. The average value
of $W_{a}$ is around 10.


\section*{Exercise 34}

The peak of the histogram is around the value of 1. The histogram
also has a tail towards the right hand side


\section*{Exercise 35}

I was interested in learning about the age rendering website that
guessed the age of a person based on an image of a person's face shown
in office hours. I was very surprised how the demo became so viral
in Turkey. He really drives home the idea of presenting machine learning
concepts to the layman. I'm surprised that it took 7 days to reach
50 million users via this method. However, it does make sense, since
it was a simple idea. I was surprised that people would share the
website when results were wrong. The tips for how to look younfer
was particularily amusing, I plan to wear contacts and shave more
often.

The tips for dealing with big data were particularity informative,
such as how more effective building in the cloud really in.


\section*{Exercise 36}

Based on the qqnorm plot, I'm inclined to say that Z has a normal
distribution. The Mean calculated was approximately 0.739 and I calculated
the standard deviation two different ways, the built in method gave
an SD of 0.897021 whereas my calculated, modeling the actual formula,
was 0.7818569.


\section*{Exercise 37}

$E(Y|X)=E(aX+b+Z|X)=E(aX|X)+E(b)+E(Z)=aE(X|X)+b+0=aX+b$


\section*{Exercise 38}


\subsection*{Part A}

Since is an event the a point $x\in R$ is accepted, then $U<\frac{l(x)}{M}$,
so X = x, thus $P(Y=x|A)=P(X=x)$


\subsection*{Part B}

$P(A|Y=x)=\frac{l(x)}{M}$


\subsection*{Part C}

$P(A)=\sum_{x\in R}P(A|Y=x)*P(Y=x)=\frac{\sum_{x\in R}l(x)}{M}*\frac{1}{N}=\frac{c}{MN}$


\subsection*{Part D}

$P(X=x)=P(Y=x|A)=\frac{P(Y=x\&A)}{P(A)}=\frac{P(A|Y=x)*P(Y=x)}{P(A)}=\frac{\frac{l(x)}{M}*\frac{1}{N}}{\frac{C}{MN}}=\frac{l(x)}{c}=p(x)$


\section*{Exercise 40}


\subsection*{Part 2}

$P(X=1|Y=y)=\frac{P(X=1\&Y=y)}{P(Y=y)}=\frac{P(Y=y|X=1)*P(X=1)}{P(Y=y|X=1)*P(X=1)+P(Y=y|X=2)*P(X=2)}=\frac{w_{1}p_{1}(y)}{w_{1}p_{1}(y)+w_{2}p_{2}(y)}$

$P(X=2|Y=y)=\frac{P(X=2\&Y=y)}{P(Y=y)}=\frac{P(Y=y|X=2)*P(X=2)}{P(Y=y|X=1)*P(X=1)+P(Y=y|X=2)*P(X=2)}=\frac{w_{2}p_{2}(y)}{w_{1}p_{1}(y)+w_{2}p_{2}(y)}$
